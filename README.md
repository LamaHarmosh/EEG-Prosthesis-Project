# üß† EEG-Controlled Prosthesis for Neurological Patients

A personal project aimed at designing and prototyping an **EEG headset** that detects brainwave activity to control prosthetic devices for patients with neurological conditions. Inspired by the OpenBCI platform, this project bridges the gap between neurotechnology and rehabilitation.

## üìå Project Objectives

- Build a custom EEG headset for capturing brainwave signals.
- Process and classify signals to trigger motor actions in a prosthetic device.
- Test and refine ergonomic and functional aspects for patient usability.
- Explore machine learning (TensorFlow) for future signal classification improvements.

## üìä Project Workflow

1. **Signal Acquisition**  
   Capture EEG signals via custom sensors placed on the scalp.

2. **Signal Filtering & Processing**  
   Filter noise and preprocess signals using Python and MATLAB scripts.

3. **Command Translation**  
   Map processed signals to prosthetic motor commands.

4. **Device Control**  
   Send commands to prosthetic hardware via Arduino/Raspberry Pi.

5. **Testing & Iteration**  
   Validate system performance with simulated tasks and adjust models.
